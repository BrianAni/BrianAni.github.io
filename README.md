# About Me

## My Interests
I enjoy listening music, writing some _occasional_ poetry, and playing sports as well as video games.

## Websites I Recommend
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org): A **great** resource for learning just about _*everything*_. You can easily get distracted reading about some people's lives too!
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com): *Perfect* for solving coding problems and learning from other developers.
